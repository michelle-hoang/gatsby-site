Disclaimer: I am just one person who has worked one job in a startup. I am not making or asserting any generalized statements about startups or the experience of working in them. Please consider this as an opinion piece. It is not the flamboyant guy spinning his whale of a yarn in the middle of a cocktail party, but rather the hesistant observations of a quiet observer. Take it with a palmful of salt, and maybe a shot of tequila and lime.
